# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is inspired by Keep a Changelog, and this project follows Semantic Versioning.

This changelog currently starts at `1.3.0`. Earlier history is available in the git log.

## [3.3.0] - 2026-04-05

### Changed

- Removed profile selection from `grace lint`; it now validates only against the current GRACE artifact set.
- Limited `.grace-lint.json` to the current schema and reject unknown keys instead of carrying compatibility paths for unused legacy config.

## [3.2.0] - 2026-04-05

### Changed

- Refactored `grace lint` into a role-aware core plus language-adapter architecture with a JS/TS AST adapter.
- Added `ROLE` and `MAP_MODE` support for governed files so tests, barrels, configs, types, and scripts are linted by semantics instead of filename masks.
- Added `auto/current/legacy` profile support and `.grace-lint.json` repository configuration.

## [3.1.1] - 2026-04-05

### Changed

- Documented the optional `grace` CLI inside `grace-explainer`, `grace-reviewer`, `grace-refresh`, and `grace-status` as a fast integrity preflight.
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` so future sessions treat the published `@osovv/grace-cli` package and `grace lint` workflow as part of the repo context.
- Switched the published CLI install example in `README.md` to `bun add -g @osovv/grace-cli`.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added

- Added `grace-refactor` for safe rename, move, split, merge, and extract workflows with synchronized contracts, graph entries, and verification refs.
- Added `docs/operational-packets.xml` templates to `grace-init` so projects get canonical `ExecutionPacket`, `GraphDelta`, `VerificationDelta`, and `FailurePacket` shapes.
- Added a Bun-based `grace` CLI on `citty` with a `lint` subcommand for unique XML tags, graph/plan/verification drift, and semantic markup integrity.

### Changed

- Updated execution, verification, ask, fix, status, and explainer skills to recognize `docs/operational-packets.xml` when present.
- Prepared the published CLI as the scoped npm package `@osovv/grace-cli` with a Bun-powered `grace` binary and prepublish verification checks.

## [3.0.4] - 2026-04-05

### Changed

- Improved worker commit message format in `grace-multiagent-execute`: requires concrete file/function/export listing and descriptive body instead of generic "harden X" phrases.
- Improved controller meta-sync commit format: lists which artifacts were updated and per-module delta description instead of bare module list.

## [3.0.3] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed

- Replaced the `plugins/grace/skills` symlink with real packaged skill files so OpenPackage can install the plugin for `opencode`.
- Added validator coverage for drift between canonical `skills/grace/*` content and the packaged copy inside `plugins/grace`.

## [3.0.2] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed

- Re-aligned the Claude Code marketplace layout with the official docs by serving the `grace` plugin from `./plugins/grace`.
- Restored the plugin manifest to `plugins/grace/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and removed the unsupported root plugin manifest.
- Updated marketplace validation to enforce relative plugin sources and to verify component paths inside each plugin source directory.

## [3.0.1] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed

- Restored Claude Code marketplace packaging to use the repository root as the plugin source so bundled skill paths resolve inside the installed plugin.
- Added a root `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` manifest and removed the broken nested `plugins/grace` packaging layout.
- Updated validation to catch missing component paths inside the declared plugin source before release.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added

- Added `docs/verification-plan.xml` as a first-class GRACE artifact template.
- Added richer `grace-init` templates for requirements, technology, development plan, and knowledge graph.
- Added GRACE explainer reference material for verification-driven and log-driven development.

### Changed

- Reframed `grace-verification` around maintained testing, traces, and log-driven evidence.
- Updated `grace-plan` to produce verification references and populate `verification-plan.xml`.
- Updated `grace-execute` and `grace-multiagent-execute` to consume verification-plan excerpts in execution packets and sync verification deltas centrally.
- Updated `grace-reviewer`, `grace-status`, `grace-refresh`, `grace-ask`, and `grace-fix` to treat verification as part of GRACE integrity.
- Refreshed README, packaging metadata, and installation paths for the nested `skills/grace/*` layout.

### Removed

- Removed `grace-generate` from the public skill set in favor of the execution-centric workflow through `grace-execute` and `grace-multiagent-execute`.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-09

### Changed

- Workers now commit their implementation immediately after verification passes, rather than waiting for controller.
- Controller commits only shared artifacts (graph, plan), not implementation files.
- Updated `grace-execute` and `grace-multiagent-execute` with explicit commit timing guidance.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-09

### Changed

- Reorganized skills directory structure: all GRACE skills moved to `skills/grace/` subfolder for better organization and namespacing.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- Added `safe`, `balanced`, and `fast` execution profiles to `grace-multiagent-execute`.
- Added controller-built execution packets to reduce repeated plan and graph reads during execution.
- Added targeted graph refresh guidance for wave-level reconciliation.
- Added explicit verification levels for module, wave, and phase checks.
- Added this `CHANGELOG.md` file.

### Changed

- Aligned `grace-execute` with the newer packet-driven, controller-managed execution model.
- Updated `grace-generate` to support controller-friendly graph delta proposals in multi-agent workflows.
- Updated `grace-reviewer` to support `scoped-gate`, `wave-audit`, and `full-integrity` review modes.
- Updated `grace-refresh` to distinguish between `targeted` and `full` refresh modes.
- Updated GRACE subagent role prompts to match scoped reviews, controller-owned shared artifact updates, and level-based verification.
- Updated `README.md` and package metadata for the `1.3.0` release.

### Fixed

- Resolved the workflow conflict where `grace-generate` previously implied direct `knowledge-graph.xml` edits even when `grace-multiagent-execute` required controller-owned graph synchronization.
